<h2>Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!</h2>
<p>Did you dress her up like this? You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! Camelot! It's only a model. Well, we did do the nose. You don't vote for kings. The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Well, I didn't vote for you. Shut up! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Who's that then? Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! I have to push the pram a lot. The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! Well, she turned me into a newt. You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! A newt? Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! The nose? I dunno. Must be a king. Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! The nose? What do you mean? And the hat. She's a witch! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! Be quiet!</p>

<h2>Tonight's the night.</h2>
<p>Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I am not a killer. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. Makes me a … scientist. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I'm really more an apartment person. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. You look…perfect. I'm generally confused most of the time. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. God created pudding, and then he rested. I'm really more an apartment person. You all right, Dexter? You look…perfect. Tell him time is of the essence. I'm generally confused most of the time. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Makes me a … scientist. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm really more an apartment person. I like seafood. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.</p>

<h2>Hi. I'm Troy McClure.</h2>
<p>Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. Ahoy hoy? Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!" I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark. "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion. Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2. I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows. Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot. I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. You don't win friends with salad. Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark.</p>
